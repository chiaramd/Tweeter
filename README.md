* [ ] User can view following / followers list through any profile they view.
* [ ] Use the popular ButterKnife annotation library to reduce view boilerplate.
* [ ] On the Twitter timeline, leverage the [CoordinatorLayout](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Handling-Scrolls-with-CoordinatorLayout#responding-to-scroll-events) to apply scrolling behavior that [hides / shows the toolbar](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Using-the-App-ToolBar#reacting-to-scroll).
* [ ] User can **open the twitter app offline and see last loaded tweets**. Persisted in SQLite tweets are refreshed on every application launch. While "live data" is displayed when app can get it from Twitter API, it is also saved for use in offline mode.
